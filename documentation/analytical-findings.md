# Analytical Findings

## 1. Structural Performance Gap: Delivery vs Pickup

Pickup operations consistently outperform Delivery operations.

- Delivery On-Time Rate: ~41–45%
- Pickup On-Time Rate: ~65–68%
- Performance Gap: ~26 percentage points

This gap indicates structural inefficiencies within the delivery workflow, particularly in last-mile execution.


## 2. Target Deviation and Performance Risk

On-Time and SLA metrics remain significantly below predefined targets.

- Persistent negative variance vs target
- Delay Rate substantially above acceptable thresholds

This reflects systemic performance degradation rather than isolated operational issues.


## 3. Regional Risk Concentration

Several states operate below 50% On-Time performance.

Low-performing regions are characterized by:

- Higher average delay minutes
- Elevated detention time
- Consistent underperformance across months

These regions represent operational risk clusters requiring prioritization.


## 4. Delay–Performance Correlation

Scatter analysis reveals a negative relationship between:

- Average Delay (minutes)
- On-Time %

Higher delay durations are directly associated with lower service reliability.

This suggests that delay mitigation is the primary lever for performance improvement.


## 5. Operational Variability Across Time

Monthly trend analysis shows:

- No sustained recovery toward target thresholds
- Performance volatility across periods
- Consistent structural gap between Delivery and Pickup

This indicates the absence of stable process control mechanisms.
